# Simple Web Components Library

This is an open-source collection of reusable web components built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to provide a library of customizable components for developers to use in their projects and to encourage developers to contribute to open source. Contributors are welcome to submit their own components!

As a student at Yrgo's web-developer class we are tasked to make contributions to the open source scene. One way of doing this is to actually have an open source project of my own. So this project is specifically targeting developers that are new to open source. This is a project that they should feel absolute safe about creating issues and pull requests, since the main goal is not to create the best ever components but the act of contributing itself!

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Navigate to the `/components` folder and add your own component folder.
3. Each component should have an `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` file.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example structure for a Button component:
