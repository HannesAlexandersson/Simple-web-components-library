## Code of Conduct

Contributers should always try to conduct themself in a manner that makes for a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We will not tolerate ANY behavior that in any way puts another fellow contributor at risk of harm, discomfort, or discrimination, including but not limited to threats, derogatory comments, or exclusionary practices. Everyone is expected to contribute to a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful environment.

### Contributions

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- At the moment I am a lone developer that handles this repo at the same time im conducting studies at Yrgo. So the timely manner of my responses might be somewhat long. But I will try my best to shorten them, but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.
- If you've never contributed before, see [the first timer's guide on our blog](https://auth0.com/blog/a-first-timers-guide-to-an-open-source-project/) for resources and tips on how to get started.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
