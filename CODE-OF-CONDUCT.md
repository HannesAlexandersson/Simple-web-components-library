## Code of Conduct

Contributers should always try to conduct themself in a manner that makes for a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We will not tolerate ANY behavior that in any way puts another fellow contributor at risk of harm, discomfort, or discrimination, including but not limited to threats, derogatory comments, or exclusionary practices. Everyone is expected to contribute to a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful environment.

### Contributions

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- New Issues: If you have an idea for a new component or improvement that isn’t covered by existing issues, feel free to open a new issue to discuss it. This allows others to provide feedback or express interest before you start coding.
- At the moment I am a lone developer that handles this repo at the same time im conducting studies at Yrgo. So the timely manner of my responses might be somewhat long. But I will try my best to shorten them, but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.
- If you've never contributed before, see [the first timer's guide](https://auth0.com/blog/a-first-timers-guide-to-an-open-source-project/) for resources and tips on how to get started.

### Issues

Use Issues to report problems with the library, request new features, or discuss potential changes before creating a PR. If you have a new idea for a component or an enhancement, opening an issue allows us to discuss the idea and plan its implementation.

### Pull Requests

PRs are a great way to get your fixes or improvements into the library. Here’s how to craft a quality PR:

- Single Concern: Address one issue or feature per PR. Avoid mixing different concerns or styles.
- Tests: If a test suite exists, include unit or integration tests for new functionality or bug fixes.
- Minimal Changes: Make the fewest changes necessary to address the issue or add the feature.
